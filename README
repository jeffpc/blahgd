Comment Spam Techniques
=======================

1) Empty form field - a hidden field that should never get filled in by
   anything.  Any bot that blindly fills in all the fields will immediately
   cause the comment to be ignored.

2) Time stamp field - a hidden field with page load Unix timestamp in
   nanoseconds.  When submitted, the delta between submission time and page
   load time must be at least COMMENT_MIN_DELAY and at most COMMENT_MAX_DELAY.

3) Math captcha - a simple math problem.  User must set it to the sum of
   COMMENT_CAPTCHA_A and COMMENT_CAPTCHA_B.

4) User agent - the user agent header (HTTP_USER_AGENT) must be present.
