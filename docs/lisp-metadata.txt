Lisp-formated Post and Comment Metadata
=======================================

We use a Lisp-type syntax to keep track of all the metadata.  For more
information about the exact syntax, look at lisp.txt in the docs directory.


Post
----

Posts' metadata is stored alongside the post text in a file called
"post.lisp".  The contents are a quoted Lisp alist.  For example:

'((time . "2015-09-19 21:28")
  (title . "abcdef")
  (fmt . 3)
  (tags "tag1" "tag2")
  (cats "cat1" "cat2")
  (comments 1 2 3)
  (listed #t))


Most entries are self explanatory.  With that said,

 time: the time of publication (UTC)

 title: the title of this post

 fmt: format version for the post text itself

 tags: list of tags associated with this post

 cats: list of categories associated with this post

 comments: entry enumerates all the comment IDs for this post

 listed: list this post on the index/category/tag/archive pages?


Comment
-------

Comments store their metadata alongside the comment text in a file called
"meta.lisp".  The contents are a quoted Lisp alist.  For example:

'((author . "bob")
  (email . "bob@example.com")
  (time . "2015-09-19 21:30")
  (ip . "10.10.10.10")
  (url . "http://example.com")
  (moderated . #t))


Again, the entries are self explanatory.

 author: the author of the comment

 email: the email address of the comment author

 time: time of comment (UTC)

 ip: the IP address used by the comment author to leave the comment

 url: the comment author's website

 moderated: has this post been moderated?
